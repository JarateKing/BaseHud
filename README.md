# BaseHud

Starting point for creating custom huds within tf2. Much of the tedious setup is already done, and a lot of valuable assets and tools are provided.

To learn more about huds in general, check out [the hud tutorial](https://github.com/JarateKing/TF2-Hud-Reference#readme).

## Features

* Auto-update script
* Reference / base default hud files
* On-start and on-first-run cfg's
* Closecaption compiler
* chat_english language converter
* Animation fixes
* Animation locking setup
* Remove play-button background-dimmer option
* Preloaded cp icons (sv_pure compatible)
* Fixes for certain existing hud materials
* Custom basic shape materials
* Custom refract and blur materials with fallbacks

Some of these features involve scripting or programs that are intended for windows. Where possible, linux is also supported.

## Modifying

There are multiple options for making use of this:
* Fork this repo and modify your own copy.
* Download this and modify.
* Start from scratch and take whatever parts you find necessary.

For more details on using specific parts of the base hud, check out the [usage](USAGE.md) file.
